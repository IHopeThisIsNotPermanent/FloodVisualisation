		<div class="mx-auto">
			<h3 class="font-weight-normal text-left">
        Flood-iction is built upon the concept of a model. At the moment this model is only capable of one form of analysis - when the Brisbane River overflows.<br>
        When given a location, it finds the height of this point using (reference????) and then provides what frequency a flood event that can flood this area would occur in.<br>
        For example, a location that is just 0.5m above the Brisbane River and adjacent to it would flood more frequently than one which is 20m above the river and 1km away.<br>
        In the future we plan to update this to include other kinds of analysis and give a weighted flood risk score considering these factors. For example:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>Flooding due to releases from the Wivenhoe Dam</li>
          <li>Flooding due to rainfall in various amounts and time periods</li>
          <li>Flooding due to tidal changes such as <a href="https://www.msq.qld.gov.au/Tides/King-tides">King Tides</a></li>
        </ul>

				This website was developed to visualize the data generated by the model for the user.
				It runs on <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/">Flask</a>, a bare bones <a href="https://www.python.org">Python</a> web application. The style of the pages is mostly done using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com">Bootstrap</a><br>

				After the user provides an address or location to search, the result is displayed on a map. This map is created by using a library called <a href="http://python-visualization.github.io/folium/">Folium</a>, which creates a <a href="https://leafletjs.com">Leaflet</a> map.<br>
				On top of this map is a Contour map, typically used to notate changes in terrain height. Here it is not height being displayed, but instead flood risk.<br>
				The model is able to at what frequency a flood severe enough to cause the given water height would occur at. This is fit on a linear scale to give the risk shown on the map.<br>
        <br>

				Some of this data is also given to the user in table form for various flood height levels.

		<div class="mx-auto">
			<h3 class="font-weight-normal text-left">
				To provide specific flood information about a given location, Flood-iction needs to find where that is on a map.<br>
				Luckily there is an existing Python library that does just this. The <a href="https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">GeoPy<a> library contains dozens of GeoCoders - APIs that turn an address "e.g. 123 John Street" or a description "e.g. Brisbane Children's Hospital" into map co-ordinates.<br>
				In particular, Flood-iction uses <a href="https://nominatim.org">Nominatim</a>. Nominatim uses open source data from the <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap Project</a> to produce co-ordinates.<br>
				This open source data is not perfect - but in and around the Brisbane City area, most of the data is complete and accurate.<br>
        <br>
        In no uncertain terms: Flood-iction does <b>not</b> actively seek out any user data that isn't supplied, such as by attempting to locate the user by their IP Address. Any addresses or locations that Flood-iction is provided by the user are <b>not</b> stored persistently, nor is it provided to any third parties.
