y = ax + b

y is the peak height of the flood, x is the peak flow rate of flood. 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
THE RESULT IS HERE

y = 0.00087 * x + 1.415

y is the peak height of the flood, x is the peak flow rate of the flood. 

(use this function with the rainfall<---->flood peak rate)

END HERE

2011 flood:

The peak flow rate around Withcott and Grantham where Lockyer Creek is joined by Gatton Creek, 
was estimated to be 3,500 m**3 second.

With the flood peaking at 4.46 metres (14.6 ft) in Brisbane City.

4.46 = 3500 * a + b

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Brisbane River peaked at 3.85m on Monday morning
about 725 gigalites, entered Wivenhoe Dam in the past three days.
725/3=241.6, 
241gigalites
241 * 10 ^9 lites, which is 241 * 10^6  (m^3)
this is one day, one day and has 241 * 10^6, and one day has 24*60*60=86,400 seconds
so 241 * 10^6 / 86400 = 2,789.3= 2,789 (m^3/sec)

3.85 = 2,789 * a + b
------------------------------------------------------------
0.61 = 711 * a
a = 0.00087

b = 1.415
------------------------------------------------
the final one is:
y = 0.00087 * x + 1.415

y is the peak height of the flood, x is the peak flow rate of the flood.
